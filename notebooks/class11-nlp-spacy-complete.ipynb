    "The spaCy library parses the underlying sentences using a [dependency grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar). Dependency grammars look different from the kinds of sentence diagramming you may have done in high school, and even from tree-based [phrase structure grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar) commonly used in descriptive linguistics. The idea of a dependency grammar is that every word in a sentence is a \"dependent\" of some other word, which is that word's \"head.\" Those \"head\" words are in turn dependents of other words. The finite verb in the sentence is the ultimate \"head\" of the sentence, and is not itself dependent on any other word. (The dependents of a particular head are sometimes called its \"children.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The question of how to know what constitutes a \"head\" and a \"dependent\" is complicated. As a starting point, here's a passage from [Dependency Grammar and Dependency Parsing](http://stp.lingfil.uu.se/~nivre/docs/05133.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here are some of the criteria that have been proposed for identifying a syntactic relation between a head H and a dependent D in a construction C (Zwicky, 1985; Hudson, 1990):\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. H determines the syntactic category of C and can often replace C.\n",
    "> 2. H determines the semantic category of C; D gives semantic specification.\n",
    "> 3. H is obligatory; D may be optional.\n",
    "> 4. H selects D and determines whether D is obligatory or optional.\n",
    "> 5. The form of D depends on H (agreement or government).\n",
    "> 6. The linear position of D is specified with reference to H.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different *types* of relationships between heads and dependents, and each type of relation has its own name. Use the displaCy visualizer (linked above) to see how a particular sentence is parsed, and what the relations between the heads and dependents are. (I've listed a few common relations below.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every token object in a spaCy document or sentence has attributes that tell you what the word's head is, what the dependency relationship is between that word and its head, and a list of that word's children (dependents). The following code prints out each word in the sentence, the tag, the word's head, the word's dependency relation with its head, and the word's children (i.e., dependent words):"

    "* `det`: this word's head is a noun, and this word is a determiner of that noun (like \"the,\" \"this,\" etc.)\n",
