    "## Fun with the Genius API\n",
    "\n",
    "Many web sites and organizations offer web APIs. We're going to go over how one API in particular works, or at least a subset of a particular web API---the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/). The idea is that by introducing you to this one API, you'll learn the tools necessary to sign up for, query, and interpret APIs from other providers as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Signing up for a Client Access Token \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use the Genius API, you need to sign up for what they call a \"client access token,\" which is another name for an API key. Do so by filling out the [New API Client form](https://genius.com/api-clients/new). If you don't yet have an account on Genius.com, you'll be prompted to register first. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next questions don't really apply to our use in class, but they're required to get your token. You can enter any words you want in \"App Name.\" Similarly, you can enter any URL in the \"Icon URL,\" \"App Website URL,\" and \"Redirect URI\" fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you'll be able to click on the \"Generate Access Token\" link to generate your client access token. \n",
    "\n",
    "The token is just a string of letters and numbers. It'll look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    6617c28c371f0a138f7912a35365564afe538605\n",
    "    \n",
    "That's your \"key\" for that API. Whenever you make a request to that API, you'll need to include your key in the request. The exact methodology for including the key will be explained below. (Note: the key above is just something I made up; it's not a valid key; don't try using it in actual requests.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Looking at the documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation for a web API usually describes what the API can do in terms of the URLs you can access, the patterns that those URLs follow, and the format of the responses. If you click on \"[Resources->Search](https://docs.genius.com/#search-h2)\" on the documentation page, you see instructions for using the \"search\" function of the Genius API, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a little confusing when you first look at it, but it's telling you the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"GET /search\" line tells you that you should append \"/search\" to your URL path to make this request.\n",
    "* The information in the blush-gray box tells you the parameter options. There is only one for search: \"q\" (that notation is pretty standard), and it can accept any search term as a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's the only one we're going to use for now, so let's make a quick test request"

    "### An aside about query strings\n",
    "\n",
    "So, one quick thing: what's with that `params` thing in the call to `requests.get()`? Well, it's there to make our lives easier. If you put `params=` into the arguments of the call to `requests.get()`, the library will take the dictionary that you passed and use it to form a query string. It does this so you don't have to figure out how to write the query string yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review what a query string looks like. Here's the example query string from the section above about URL structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ?arg1=baz&arg2=quux\n",
    "    \n",
    "At first glance, it looks like garbage. For another perspective, let's look at the query string from the example request to the Genius API:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ?token=6617c28c371f0a138f7912a35365564afe538605&q=Respect\n",
    "    \n",
    "A little bit of the structure becomes more apparent here! It looks like we have a series of key/value, separated by ampersands (`&`): `token=6617c28c371f0a138f7912a35365564afe538605` and `q=Respect`. The pairs themselves are separated by equal signs (`=`).\n",
    "\n",
    "What we'd like to have, then, is some kind of way to write an expression that turns a Python dictionary into a string formatted correctly to include in a query string. It turns out that the process of doing this is [kind of tricky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding), so the `requests` library does the hard work for us when we pass the parameters to the `requests.get()` function with the named `params` parameter. Very handy!"
