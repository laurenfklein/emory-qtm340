    "\n",
    "Thanks to Alison Parrish, we have a very simple example of HTML to begin with. It is about kittens. [Here's the rendered version](http://static.decontextualize.com/kittens.html), and [here's the HTML source code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ledeprogram/courses/master/databases/data/kittens.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "First we're going to use Developer Tools in Chrome to take a look at how `kittens.html` is organized. Click on the \"rendered version\" link above. In Chrome, ctrl-click (or right click) anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect Element.\" This will open Chrome's Developer Tools. Your screen should look (something) like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/kittens-dev-tools.png\"><img src=\"http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/kittens-dev-tools.png\" alt=\"kittens-dev-tools\"/></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the upper panel, you see the web page you're inspecting. In the lower panel, you see a version of the HTML source code, with little arrows next to some of the lines. (The little arrows allow you to collapse parts of the HTML source that are hierarchically related.) As you move your mouse over the elements in the top panel, different parts of the source code will be highlighted. Chrome is showing you which parts of the source code are causing which parts of the page to show up. Pretty spiffy!\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship also works in reverse: you can move your mouse over some part of the source code in the lower panel, which will highlight in the top panel what that source code corresponds to on the page. We'll be using this later to visually identify the parts of the page that are interesting to us, so we can write code that extracts the contents of those parts automatically.\n",

    "### Scraping kittens with Beautiful Soup\n",
    "\n",
    "We've examined `kittens.html` a bit now. What we'd like to do is write some code that is going to extract information from the HTML, like \"what is the last checkup date for each of these kittens?\" or \"what are Monsieur Whiskeur's favorite TV shows?\" To do so, we need to *parse* the HTML, and create a representation of it in our program that we can manipulate with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, HTML is hard to parse by hand. (Don't even try it. In particular, [don't parse HTML with regular expressions](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454).)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Python library that parses HTML (even if it's poorly formatted) and allows us to extract and manipulate its contents. More specifically, it gives us some Python objects that we can call methods on to poke at the data contained therein. So instead of working with strings and bytes, we can work with Python objects, methods and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Anaconda, Beautiful Soup comes pre-installed, so there's no extra installation step! (We will learn how to install new libraries in future classes). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Beautiful Soup only *parses* HTML. It's left to us to actually *get* the HTML from somewhere. In most cases, we'll want to download the HTML directly from the actual web. For that, we'll use the `get` method from the Python library `requests` ([link](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/)):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Side note:** Since you're familiar with R, you know what a function is: a block of organized, reusable code that is called by a name, and performs some sort of action. Python has functions too, as well as things called methods, which are functions that are associated only with a particular object or class. Keep on reading to see an example of the \n",
