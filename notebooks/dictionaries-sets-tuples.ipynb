    "# Dictionaries, Sets, Tuples\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "The dictionary is a very useful data structure in Python. The easiest way to conceptualize a dictionary is that it's like a list, except you don't look up values in a dictionary by their index in a sequence---you look them up using a \"key,\" or a unique identifier for that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to focus here just on learning how to get data *out* of dictionaries, not how to build new dictionaries from existing data. We're also going to omit some of the nitty-gritty details about how dictionaries work internally. You'll learn a lot of those details in later courses, but for now it means that some of what I'm going to tell you will seem weird and magical. Be prepared!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why dictionaries?\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purposes, the benefit of having data that can be parsed into dictionaries, as opposed to lists, is that dictionary keys tend to be *mnemonic*. That is, a dictionary key will usually tell you something about what its value is. (This is in opposition to parsing, say, CSV data, where we have to keep counting fields in the header row and translating that to the index that we want.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists and dictionaries work together and are used extensively to represent all different kinds of data. Often, when we get data from a remote source, or when we choose how to represent data internally, we'll use both in tandem. The most common form this will take is representing a table, or a database, as a *list* of records that are themselves represented as *dictionaries* (mapping the name of the column to the value for that column). We'll see an example of this when we access web APIs in a subsequent tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are also good for storing *associations* or *mappings* for quick lookups. For example, if you wanted to write a program that was able to recall the capital city of every US state, you might use a dictionary whose keys are the names of the states, and whose values are the corresponding capitals. Dictionaries are also used for data analysis tasks, like keeping track of how many times a particular token occurs in an incoming data stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What dictionaries look like\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, surrounding a series of comma-separated pairs of *keys* and *values*. Here's a very simple dictionary, with one key, `Obama`, associated with a value, `Hawaii`:"

    "What gives? Here's what's up. Underneath the hood, Python stores the key/value pairs in a dictionary *in the order you added them to the dictionary*. This means that when you add a new item to the dictionary, it will show up *last* when you iterate over the dictionary (or get a list of its keys or values, etc.). However, when you simply evaluate a dictionary, Jupyter Notebook takes it upon itself to display the keys in *alphabetical order* instead. So the order that Jupyter Notebook shows the key/value pairs in is *not* the same as the order for the key/value pairs you would get if you iterated over the list in a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add to the confusion, in previous versions of Python, the order of key/value pairs in a dictionary was *arbitrary* (i.e., deterministic but not repeatable; adding the same items to a dictionary might produce different orderings across Python sessions). And the developers have warned us that this aspect of dictionaries might change in the future ([technical discussion here](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2016-September/146327.html)). So don't rely on the fact that *right now* Python preserves insertion order in dictionaries."

    "### Why tuples? Why now?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"So,\" you think to yourself. \"Tuples are just like... broken lists. That's strange and a little unreasonable. Why even have them in your programming language?\" That's a fair question, and answering it requires a bit of knowledge of how Python works with these two kinds of values (lists and tuples) behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, tuples are *faster* and *smaller* than lists. Because lists can be modified, potentially becoming larger after they're initialized, Python has to allocate more memory than is strictly necessary whenever you create a list value. If your list grows beyond what Python has already allocated, Python has to allocate more memory. Allocating memory, copying values into memory, and then freeing memory when it's when no longer needed, are all (perhaps surprisingly) slow processes---slower, at least, than using data already loaded into memory when your program begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a tuple can't grow or shrink after it's created, Python knows exactly how much memory to allocate when you create a tuple in your program. That means: less wasted memory, and less wasted time allocating a deallocating memory. The cost of this decreased resource footprint is less versatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples are often called an immutable data type. \"Immutable\" in this context simply means that it can't be changed after it's created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tuples in the standard library\n",
    "\n",
    "Because tuples are faster, they're often the data type that gets returned from methods and functions in Python's built-in library. For example, the .items() method of the dictionary object returns a list of tuples (rather than, as you might otherwise expect, a list of lists):"
