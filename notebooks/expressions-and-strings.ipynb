    "# Python basics: Expressions and strings\n",
    "\n",
    "By [Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "In ths tutorial, I show how to use Python's interactive interpreter to write simple Python expressions. I go into particular detail on Python's string manipulation functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The interactive interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first experiments with Python will take place in Python's \"interactive interpreter.\" This is an interface that allows you to type Python code and see the results of your code instantly. Later on, we'll make Python programs that live in their own little files; but for now, we'll just type simple programs directly into the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To launch the Python interactive interpreter, simply type the word `python` on the command-line:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ python\n",
    "    \n",
    "You'll see something that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python 3.6.1 |Anaconda 4.4.0 (x86_64)| (default, May 11 2017, 13:04:09) \n",
    "    [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin\n",
    "    Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\n",
    "    >>> \n",
    "\n",
    "The `>>>` is the interactive interpreter's prompt. It means, \"type some Python please.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note on Python versions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main \"branches\" of Python in current use: Python 2 and Python 3. Both of these branches have their own versions: the latest version of Python 2 (as of this writing) is Python 2.7.x, and the latest version of Python 3 is Python 3.6.x. The branches and versions all have slightly different capabilities and their syntax and structure are slightly different. Python 2.7.x still has a larger number of users overall, and many new projects continue to support it. But most data scientists and data journalists using Python today use the newer version, and following their lead, we'll be using we're using Python 3.6 in this course (specifically, the version included with the latest version of [Anaconda](FIXME). \n",
    "\n",
    "(The main reason you need to know this information is that you should be careful when looking up Python information on the Internet---make sure whatever tutorial you're looking at is about Python 3, not Python 2.)"

    "## Expressions and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a very high-level description of how computer programming works. When you're writing a computer program, you're describing to the computer what you want, and then asking the computer to figure that thing out for you. Your description of what you want is called an *expression*. The process that the computer uses to turn your expression into whatever that expression means is called *evaluation.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a science fiction movie where a character asks the computer, out loud, \"What's the square root of nine billion?\" or \"How many people older than 50 live in Paris, France?\" Those are examples of expressions. The process that the computer uses to transform those expressions into a response is evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the process of evaluation is complete, you're left with a single \"value\". Think of it schematically like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Expression -> Evaluation -> Value](http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/expressiondiagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes computer programs powerful is that they make it possible to write very precise and sophisticated expressions. And importantly, you can embed the results of evaluating one expression inside of another expression, or save the results of evaluating an expression for later in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, computers can't understand and intuit your desires simply from a verbal description. That's why we need computer programming languages: to give us a way to write expressions in a way that the computer can understand. Because programming languages are designed to be precise, they can also be persnickety (and frustrating). And every programming language is different. It's tricky, but worth it."

The way that you write arithmetic expressions in Python is very similar to the way that you write arithmetic expressions in, say, grade school arithmetic, or algebra. In the example below, `3 + 5` is the expression. In the interactive interpreter, you can tell Python to evaluate the expression and display its value simply by typing in the expression right after the prompt (`>>>`)."

    "Okay, we're getting somewhere together! But I've still been using a lot of jargon when explaning this stuff. One thing that might confuse you: what's a \"function\" and what's a \"method\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "We've talked about two \"functions\" so far: `len()` and `type()`. A function is a special word that you can use in Python expressions that runs some pre-defined code: you put your expression inside the parentheses, and Python sends the result of evaluating that expression to the code in the function. That code operates on the value that you gave it, and then itself evaluates to another value. Using a function in this way is usually called \"calling\" it or \"invoking\" it. The stuff that you put inside the parentheses is called a \"parameter\" or \"argument\"; the value that the function gives back is called its \"return value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Function diagram](http://static.decontextualize.com/snaps/functiondiagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `len()` and `type()` functions are two of what are called \"built-in functions,\" i.e. functions that come with Python and are available whenever you're writing Python code. In Python, built-in functions tend to be able to take many different types of value as parameters. ([There are a lot of other built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html), not just `len()` and `type()`! We'll discuss them as the need arises.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: You can also write your own functions---we'll learn how to do this later in the class. Writing functions is a good way to avoid repetition in your code and to compartmentalize it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Methods\" work a lot like functions, except in how it looks when you use them. Instead of putting the expression that you want to use them with inside the parentheses, you put the call to the method directly AFTER the expression that you want to call it on, following a period (`.`). Methods, unlike built-in functions, are usually only valid for one type of value; e.g., values of the string type have a `.strip()` method, but integer values don't.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to remember that methods can be called both on an expression that evaluates to a particular value AND on a variable that contains that value. So you can do this:"
