    "Jupyter Notebook is a browser-based platform for programming in Python, which allows you to intersperse executable code with chunks of text like this. It lets you (mostly) avoid the command line, and results in a file that is easy to read and easy to share with others. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using Jupyter Notebooks for in-class exercises and for many of the homework assignments. In order to manage these various notebooks, I recommend using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), which I'll discuss at the end of this class. I'm separating these discussions so that you don't get confused as to which platform does which thing, but the TL;dr version is that Jupyter is for writing and running code, and GitHub is for sharing it. \n",

    "A Jupyter Notebook consists of a number of \"cells,\" stacked on the page from top to bottom. Cells can have text or code in them. You can change a cell's type using the \"Cell\" menu at the top of the page; go to `Cell > Cell Type` and select either `Code` for Python code or `Markdown` for text. (You can also change this for the current cell using the drop-down menu in the toolbar.)"
